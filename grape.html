    University Prepares To Offset The Costs Of A New Collective Agreement With Teaching Assistants
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">12/1/2017&mdash;</span>According to a source close to the administration, the President is not concerned with the outcome of the GTA bargaining. The source explained, <q>We [the university - editor's note] will just recalculate the graduate research scholarship.</q>
When we pointed out that the current collective agreement has earnings protection, the source doubted that such protection would be effective. Failing to hide his excitement, the source suggested that university has many ways to control funding, 
including offering a lower funding package to newcomers. <q>Even if our bargaining team yields to GTAs' wage demands, the administration will just raise tuition fees to cover the costs of the new collective agreement,</q> concluded the source, grinning. 
When we asked if the university considered the possibility of GTAs going on strike in response to such treatment, the source beamed with pride, <q>That's why we are delaying bargaining - who will stay on a picket line in February?</q>

    Best Student Experience
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">11/24/2017&mdash;</span>To live up to its ambitious slogan – “Best Student Experience” – Western University developed the
Institutional Quality Assurance Process (IQAP) in 2011. According to Western's Quality Council, Western
is committed to offering graduate and undergraduate programs of high quality.<br>

<q>Our quality assurance processes reflect our commitment to excellence in undergraduate and graduate
education,</q> reads Western's Institutional Quality Assurance Process policy document.<br>

When asked about what's involved when a department undergoes an IQAP review, one graduate chair
remarked that it involved careful strategy.<br>

<q>You need to ensure the IQAP review committee doesn't get to chatting with any Year X, mature, or non-
externally funded students in the department. Smoke and mirrors until they're out the door.</q><br>

A graduate student from the same department and the Chair of the Department's Graduate Association
remarked that departments always manage to find money in the budget for IQAP reviews.<br>

<q>You should have seen the spread at the department's cocktail reception for the IQAP committee. Now it
makes sense why our travel funding was cut back this year. We were very happy to sacrifice our funding
to ensure the department received a high quality approval rating.</q><br>

An anonymous source from SGPS stated that administration spends most of its budget on refreshments.
Graduate students love free food. When administration know something bad is coming down the line, they pull out
all the stops. Food Services makes a killing off graduate student money.
With bargaining just around the corner, be sure to keep an eye out for these enticing spreads.

    Provost: Increasing Tuition Is Not Enough To Maintain The University's Spending Pattern
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">11/15/2017&mdash;</span>With government freezing the funding of universities, the provost lamented that regulation caps tuition increases at 3%, 
but was happy to report there is no such cap for international students. Whether 3% or more, she assured the campus community that tuition increases are a valuable tool.
<q>We have benefited a lot from the compliance of Western students with respect to tuition increases,</q> provost reminded that while the tuition increase in Quebec resulted in 
student demonstrations, in this part of Ontario it went well. Still, she noted that the 3% tuition increase would only generate 1.5% of operational budget increase and that in recent 
years Western's expenditures increase 4.5% per year. <q>Everyone will feel the cuts in spending,</q> the provost concluded. When asked about the impact on the graduate students, 
the provost assured that the minimal guarantee for Doctoral students - which with the current level of fees leaves $872/month for international and $932/month for domestic students - remains intact. 
No comments were made with regard to Master's. &mdash; Western's Budget Town Hall, 31 Oct, UCC McKellar Room.

    Western Fall Preview Day Will Showcase T.A. Work

<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">11/10/2017&mdash;</span>As Western University gets ready for its Fall Preview Day on November 
12, departments are excited to showcase the work of their Graduate 
Teaching Assistants. <q>It's very rewarding for us that parents and 
incoming students will see their future T.A.s on campus, in a Sunday 
afternoon, drinking coffee to get their work done,</q> an SGPS official 
told The Grape. He added: <q>who knows, some of them might even be in 
their pajamas from the night before!</q> We consulted a T.A. about whether 
she plans to be at Western on Sunday. <q>Obviously, it's midterm season. 
And what is this preview day thing about?</q>

    Local Union Saves Money On Pamphlets

    Union Practices Bargaining On Self

    University Prepared For Bargaining With GTAs
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">10/2/2017&mdash;</span>Ahead of this falls bargaining, Western's administration is confident. <q>We don't need much preparation. We just offer them the same wage increase that we offer other campus unions</q> says a member of the university's bargaining team, who asked to remain anonymous. <p> When asked for the rationale behind treating GTAs pay raises the same as pay raises to the much higher paid faculty and staff, the source explained, <q>We find that strategy really removes the headache from the process. Otherwise we have to listen to them present these really sad cases of graduate students with children or health conditions which really bring us down. It's much better to not have to think about these things, and the simple 1-2% rule lets us just zone out for the bargaining meetings.</q> </p><p> When asked if GTAs will accept this, the source explained <q>That's the easiest part. We take something away right before bargaining. By the time they bargain for it back, they feel they gained something.</q> When we asked a GTA to comment, his jaw dropped. Similar responses, apparently out of shock, mean we haven't yet got a GTA to comment verbally by the time of publishing.

    GTA Bargaining Team Is Divided Over What The Recent Postdocs Bargaining Means For Them
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">9/28/2017&mdash;</span>One GTA bargaining team member speculated that <q>this is definitely a bad sign. It looks like bargaining is off the bargaining table all together this year. The university is simply not interested in negotiating and that's not good for anyone.</q> <p> 

Another team member was determined to look on the bright side, <q>Look, they saved a lot of money in the postdocs bargaining. Heck, I think they may have even made money. The university was flush before and even moreso now.</q> </p><p>

We reached out to postdocs for their comments on these statements, but no response yet. According to several sources close to postdocs, they are pissed off.

    International Graduate Student Finds Studying In Canada To Be An Experience Like No Other

<blockquote cite="http://grad.uwo.ca/current_students/international_students/index.html">
Studying in Canada is an experience like no other. One of the most beautiful and multicultural nations on earth, the people of Canada are extremely friendly and embrace new cultures.
</blockquote>
We wanted to find out more. We asked Zhou, a new international student at Western, how she found her first month here: <q>The university was really welcoming, and the department very friendly. They even asked if I have any friends back home that would want to come. To any domestic students that feel they aren't valued by their department, I highly recommend paying double the tuition.</q>

    Western Ensures That Graduate Students Have Stable Funding
</h1>
<div class="grape_text">
     <span class="grape_date">9/25/2017&mdash;</span>According to SGPS website, 
<blockquote cite="http://grad.uwo.ca/prospective_students/finances/index.html">
While at Western, you will want to devote your full energy to the successful completion of your studies, so we want to ensure that stable funding is available to you.
</blockquote>
We wanted to find out more, so we asked Abbas, a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science. Abbas came to Western to specialize in computing limit points of quasi-components of regular chains (and applications). When asked how he found the funding here, he appeared agitated: <q>The minimum funding is 30,501 a year, but with tuition of $7026 for the fall term, I am left with $884 a month. Not only can I not afford to live anywhere near the campus, it is still not possible to pay for basic expenses like cell phone and groceries.</q> 
<p>
When we pointed out that Western ensures <i>stable</i> funding, not funding you can live on he appeared perplexed, <q>This is my last year of funding. Like others in my program, I will need to be here for a fifth year. I can't think of how I can do this. How is this stable?</q>
